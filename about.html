  <h1> What LHI was born out of  </h1>
</div>

<div id="story">
  Let’s Hear It was started by Maya Frai, a junior at Cornell University studying Information and Computer Science. Maya started LHI in March of 2018 to initially provide a platform in the form of an online directory, where people can view featured women leading change and initiatives to improve the current climate for women in various industries.
<br> <br>
  2018 spurred a wave of news articles featuring women as victims of sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, and unequal treatment. The women who were brave enough to share these stories were highlighted in the press and motivated others to speak out as well. In order to maintain their relevancy, LHI compiled links to these stories on leading women in tech, entertainment, politics, and more to provide women with a list of inspirational figures to discover, follow, and keep up with.

What the purpose of LHI is

  </h1>
</div>

<div id="story">
  Through the development of the platform, there was an organic need to provide authentic, original content targeted towards inspiring and advising the next generation of women. In conjunction to the directory of women on the main LHI platform, the publication was created to provide editorial content to the LHI audience. Therefore, the purpose of LHI is <strong> to provide content and opportunities to inspire, empower, and connect the next generation of modern women. </strong>

    What LHI values

  </h1>
</div>

<div id="story">
  <strong>Authenticity</strong>
<br> <br>
We value originality and genuine passion to helping and inspiring women. We feature women who embrace their interests, passions, and experiences to help and inspire other women.
<br> <br>

<strong>Individuality </strong>
<br> <br>
We’re inclusive of all genders, ethnicities, races, and personal values through believing in the empowerment of diversity. We also believe that there’s no one-size fits all solution and love to hear stories about women doing things differently to make progress.
<br> <br>

<strong>Community </strong>
<br> <br>
We’re inspired by the many women who have contributed to the improvement of the platform and aim to connect them with our audience.
<br> <br>

<strong>Innovation </strong>
<br> <br>
We’re okay with never being satisfied in order to constantly improve and find new ways of achieving our goals.
